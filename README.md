## üõ†Ô∏è Project Overview

### üß© **Purpose**:
- The application receives a **4-digit binary number** transmitted from an Arduino device via the **HC-05 Bluetooth Module**.
- The binary number is calculated using **flex sensors** based on the user‚Äôs finger movements.
- Upon receiving the binary number, the app matches it to a predefined dictionary of numbers and texts.
- The application **reads out the associated text** using text-to-speech functionality.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **How It Works**:
1. **Flex Sensor Input**: The user's finger movements are captured using flex sensors connected to Arduino.
2. **Binary Conversion**: The Arduino calculates a 4-digit binary number based on the input.
3. **Bluetooth Transmission**: The binary number is transmitted to the Android app via the HC-05 Bluetooth module.
4. **App Processing**:
   - Receives the binary number.
   - Matches it to a predefined text in its dictionary.
   - Reads out the corresponding text aloud using the phone's speaker.
